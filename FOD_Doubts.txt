99.1 % Non-FOD | 0.9% FOD
Train set - 
class0 - 24141
class1 - 230
Val set -
class0 - 3449
class1 - 33
Test set -
class 0 - 6898
class 1 - 66

>> Look into different metrics - 
1. mAP score
2. precision
3. F1 score


Training Resnet - 
>> Try changing shuffling parameter. ('shuffle' = True) - done
>> Try adding schedduler - done
>> Results dramatically changed after normalization

Results for Different Models - https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-cifar-10
Results for Different Optimizers - https://paperswithcode.com/sota/

Possible Next Steps - 

1. we have not tried Data Augmentation yet.
2. we can also look into different optimizers.
3. WE CAN ALSO LOOK INTO HYPER-PARAMETER TUNING.
4. there can be a test on different optimizer, we are currently using SGD. Authors have used Adam.
5. Make more annotations
6. In initial epochs, ASL shows state-of-the art results when compared to cross-entropy loss.

We have extracted 32x32 images from the annotations. The data has been split into train,val, and test sets with 70%,10%, and 20% ratios. Each train,val and test folder contains class_0 and class_1 folder. Class_0 for "NON-FOD" and class_1 for "FOD".
Kindly, follow the same link to find the extracted images.
